### 句型精讲1

`After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town.`

该句前半部分采用过去完成时 -- “had left a small village”；
该句后半部分采用一般过去时，过去动作”是drove on”，继续开车。
> on 加在动词的后面表示继续

### 句型精讲2

`As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language.`

- as soon as 表示“一...就” (等于 =immediately after)

时态上，如果强调先后，可以用过去完成时，但不是必须。因为as soon as连接的两个动作相隔比较近，有时几乎是同时发生。

I was so exhausted. As soon as my head touched the pillow, I just fell asleep.
我太累了，头刚碰到枕头，我就睡着了。



### 句型精讲3

`As I soon learnt, he was English himself`

> `As + 主语 + 动词`，+ 从句 表示：正如......

如：As we know, the New Concept English is very good. 众所周知，新概念英语非常好。

himself 反身代词单独放在句尾，起强调作用。
