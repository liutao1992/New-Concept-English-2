歌手朴树有一首很好听的《平凡之路》

“我曾经跨过山和大海 也穿过人山人海

我曾经拥有着一切转眼都飘散如烟

我曾经失落失望失掉所有方向

直到看见平凡才是唯一的答案”

如果用英文来表达，你可以说：

I used to trek over mountains, sail across the oceans, and walk through the crowds.

> used to表示曾经做过的事

Everything I used to own was gone with the wind in a blink of an eye.    

> in a blink of an eye表示：一眨眼的功夫

I was lost, disappointed and disoriented,

until I realized being a stoic was the only answer.
