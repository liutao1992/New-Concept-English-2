### 句型精讲

`1. In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole, the American explorer, R. E. Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for the first time.`

该句包含2处同位语。
 
第一句同位语：`three years after his flight over the North Pole`。该句同位语解释了1929年对R. E. Byrd 有什么特殊意义。虽然该句并非句子主干信息，然而它却很巧妙的告诉我们3年前它飞过了北极，也暗示我们R. E. Byrd是位有经验的飞行家。

第二句同位语：`R. E. Byrd`. 指的是美国探险家是谁？

### was able to和could一样么？

> We use could for general ability . But if we want to say that someone did something in a specific situation , we should use was（were）able to or managed to .

场景1：

`When I was young, I could run a marathon . But now , I can’t.`

> could表示潜在的能力，一般性的能力，而并没有指具体做了，如特指在某场马拉松的比赛

`When I was young , I was able to run a marathon.`

> 该句也可以使用was able to进行描述

场景2：

`Even though the old man was 70 , he was able to complete the marathon yesterday. = managed to do [succeeded in doing sth difficult]`

> 描述了具体的事件，具体做到，而不是潜在的能力。


### 如何表达原因状语从句？

`Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away, for there were no more mountains in sight.`

> 注意：这句话中的for 表示，补充说明原因。表示原因状语的四大连词：Because / since / as / for

- because 

because的语义重心在哪？because引导的在后半部分，because起强调作用。
Because表示“强调原因”，用来回答Why的问题. 

- for
 
 for的语义重心在哪？在前半部分，for起到解释补充前半部分的结论、判断。
 For通常表示：“补充原因”所以通常不放句首，主要用于书面语。

- Since / As表示什么类型的原因？

表示已知原因

比如：
`Since we love each other, we should get married.`

既然我们彼此想爱，那么我们应该结婚。

`As I am getting married, I am so busy preparing the wedding.`

由于我们即将结婚了，因此我们正忙着准备婚礼。

> 因为用到as，表明交流对象是知道他要结婚的。
