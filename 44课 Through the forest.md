### 句型精讲1

`Mrs Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran through a forest after two men.`

比较：
`When Mrs Anne Sterling ran through a forest after two men, she did not think of the risk she was taking.`

场景1：
`Step back, if you don’t want to die.`

> 该句强调 Step back，也就是强调后退一步。

场景2： 
`If you don’t want to die, step back.`

> 该句强调 If you don’t want to die，也就是强调如果不想死。

其区别：虽意思相近，但其强调的部分并不同。

### 句型精讲2

`They had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag.`

为啥不写成：

`While she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children, the two men had rushed up to her and tried to steal her handbag.`

> 为了保证句子的连贯性。`They had rushed up to her` 与上一句`she ran through a forest after two men.`; `tried to steal her handbag.` 与下面一句`In the struggle，the strap broke and` 进行衔接，这样一来可以保证故事环环相扣，故事节奏变得紧凑。至于不是很关键的时间状语，则放中间。`while she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children`

`... rushed up to ...` 一直冲到某个人面前，up to的本质是接近的意思。

`... tried to steal ...` 

有同学问说，两个人冲到Mrs. Sterling面前，这不是光天化日下打劫么，是否应该是rob ？

为啥这里用steal ?

steal和rob的根本区别是:
> Steal vs rob

动词 “steal” 和 “rob” 的意思均为 “未经允许拿走某物”。

动词 “steal” 的意思是 “偷窃”，后接被偷走的事物。

动词 “rob” 的意思是 “抢走”，后接遭受抢劫的受害者。

`In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in their possession, both men started running through the trees.`

> 为啥with the bag in their possession插入在句子中间？ 

也是为了句子的连贯性，与 In the struggle，the strap broke，with the bag in their possession等情节保持一致。

> with +名词+ in one’s possession :某个东西在某人的手中，某人拥有某个东西

作用：with +名词+介词短语可以做状语（常表伴随或原因）：

`With 28 gold medals in his possession, Michael Phelps has become the most  successful Olympian of all time.`

拥有 28 块金牌的迈克尔菲尔普斯已经成为历史上最成功的奥运选手。

`With the valuable diamond in his possession, Jack became the richest person in the town.`

Jack 拥有一块最贵的钻石，因此他成为了镇上最富有的人。

### 句型精讲4

`'The strap needs mending', said Mrs Annie later, 'but they did not steal anything.'`

>注意：sth. needs doing往往表示被动= sth. needs to be done

When we are talking about the object that is going to have something done to it,   we can say that it needs doing or it needs to be done.

造句：
Your hair needs cutting. = Your hair needs to be cut. = You need a haircut.
