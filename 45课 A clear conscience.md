### 句型精讲1

`Sam Benton, the local butcher, had lost his wallet while taking his savings to the post-office. `

> 语言中的“省略”本质思维是什么？

亮点欣赏：本句相当于 while he was taking his savings to the post-office.  

省略了"he was" （主语+助动词）

省略的核心思维：简洁，减少无效重复的信息，突出重点信息。这样一来可以提升沟通中的效率。

如上，我们省略了"he was" ，但我们可以从上下文推断出省略的部分。

> 状语从句中省略的前提 ==> 主句和从句的主语一致

#### 举例

Hold my hand while crossing the road. =  You should hold my hand while you are crossing the road. 

When talking to my dad, I felt very nervous. = When I was talking to my dad, I felt very nervous. 

Although raised in a small village, Jack had never given up his dream of traveling around the world.  

= Although Jack was raised in a small village, he had never given up his dream of travelling around the world. 

### 精讲句型2

`Sam was sure that the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers, but it was not returned to him.`

> 这句话的亮点在哪？

注意：本句中用了被动语态，the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers, but it was not returned to him. 为啥用被动？ 

> 因为上一句刚刚提到丢钱包的这件事，所以下一句呢我们就想知道钱包去哪了呢？钱包就是这句话的主角。所以用wallet做主语，突出它的去向，这就使得文章过度的更加自然，更加的连贯。

- 表示确定无疑： be sure that ...
