### 句型精讲1

Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed.

> be tired of "对......感到厌倦"

`Tired of sleeping on the floor` 做分词状语，相当于：Because he was tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed.


Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house.

`Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him` 做分词状语，相当于：After he glanced at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house.

> 分词状语的本质：相当于状语从句的简化

- 何时省略连词？
 
连词的作用是表达逻辑关系。表达原因--because，表达时间--when，表达条件--if。如果句子前后的逻辑关系就很清晰，那么我们就可以省略掉连词。

After I had brushed my teeth, I went to bed. = Having brushed my teeth, I went to bed.

为什么可以省略after呢？因为have这个助动词已经表达了动作的先后关系。但有的时候，你想让逻辑关系更加清晰，突出这个时间的话，也可以保留after，也可以采用这样的表达：After having brushed my teeth, I went to bed.

- 何时省略主语？

前后主语一致的情况下，可以省略主语，避免重复，听众不会有误解。如果主语不一致，则需要保留。

- 谓语如何处理？                                

1. 实义动词（表达实际动作的动词）：主动用现在分词；被动用过去分词。

如1：

After he glanced at （主动） the bits of wood and metal .... 

如果想变成分词状语，我们可以这样表达：

Glancing at the the bits of wood and metal...

如2：

Because he was tired（被动）of sleeping on the floor 

如果想变成分词状语，我们可以这样表达：

Tired of sleeping  

> 这里我们使用过去分词作为原因状语

2. be动词改成being，但大多数情况下可以省略。

比如: 

As he was very eager to win , he worked super hard.   
>由于他特别渴望胜利，所以他非常努力。

= Being very eager to win, he worked super hard.

= Very eager to win, he worked super hard.

3. 如果状语从句中涉及完成时助动词，had或者have，我们往往改成having，而这个having，我们通常是不能省略的。因为这个had或者have带有时间先后信息。

如：After I had brushed my teeth, I went to bed.

可改为：Having brushed my teeth, I went to bed. 但不能改为：Brushed my teeth, I went to bed.  

分词状语往往可以充当：

1） 时间状语

2） 原因状语 

3） 条件状语  

4） 让步状语 

5） 伴随状语

6） 结果状语


### 单独分词结构（前后主语一致）

场景1：You got lost in a forest（你在森林中迷路了）.

Though I had walked in the forest for three hours, I still couldn’t find the way out.

想变成分词状语，如何对状语从句进行简化？

Having walked in the forest for three hours, I still couldn’t find the way out.

> 由于主句与从句中，主语都是`I`，所以我们可以对从句中的主语进行省略。其次我们将`had`变成了`having`。这里之所以变成having是因为要为了表达先后顺序。因为原句中使用的是`过去完成时`，所以这个had不能轻易省略，如果省略了，这个句子的表达就有缺失了。


Because I didn’t know where to go, I felt very scared.

如何变成分词状语？

Not knowing where to go, I felt very scared.
> 从句中我们省略了连词Because，主语 I 以及助动词did。

Because I didn’t know where to go, I felt very scared.

Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a wolf.  

Because I was scared by what I saw, I was speechless.

如何变成分词状语？

Scared by what I saw, I was speechless.
> 我们这里省略了从句的连词Because、主语 I 以及be动词。然后使用动词的过去分词--Scared表示被动。

When I saw a hunter pass by, I shouted for help.

如何变成分词状语？

Seeing a hunter pass by, I shouted for help.

> 我们这里省略了从句的连词When、主语 I。然后使用动词的现在分词--Seeing表示主动，因为saw是一个主动动作。

When the wolf heard my voice, it rushed towards me immediately.

如何变成分词状语？

Hearing my voice, the wolf rushed towards me immediately.

Just at that moment , the hunter fired tow shots, and he killed the wolf.

如何变成分词状语？

Just at that moment, the hunter fired two shots, killing the wolf.  
> 这里我们使用 killing the wolf 作为结果状语。

I looked at the wolf in front of me and I was still filled with horror.
我看着前面的狼，我心中充满恐惧。

如何变成分词状语？

I looked at the wolf in front of me, still filled with horror.  
> 这里我们将其后半部分变成了伴随状语

>  什么是伴随状语？

通俗的说就是跟随前面的动作同时存在或发生的动作或状况，当我们说完一句话，表达了主要的意思之后，还想补充一些信息，或者是再想表达一个与它同时发生的动作，这个时候我们就会使用伴随状语。

The hunter walked up to me, saying “Don’t be afraid, just follow me. ”
> 这里的saying也相当于伴随状语

Finally, we went out of the dangerous forest, leaving the dead wolf behind（离开了那只死去的恶狼）.

### 独立分词结构（前后主语不一致，从句有自己的主语）

After all the money had been spent, I had to borrow from my friends.
> 从句主语是the money，主句主语是 I，因此不能省略主语，因此我们可以这样简化：

All the money having been spent, I had to borrow from my friends..

> 注：也可以理解原因状语：Since all the money had been spent, I had to ...

> 独立分词中的特殊用法：with +独立分词

- 若with放前面，则表示原因
- 若with放后面，则表示伴随状语

I looked at the burger on the table, with my mouth watering. = I looked at the burger on the table and my mouth was watering.

我看着桌上的汉堡，口水直流。

With the cost soaring , the company had to lay off workers.= Because the cost was soaring , the company had to lay off workers

因为\由于公司成本飞涨，公司不得不裁员。
