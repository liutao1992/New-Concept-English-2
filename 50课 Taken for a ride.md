### 句型精讲

`I will tell you where to get off. (我告诉你哪里下车)`

>在这个句子中，副词where加上动词不定式`to get off`组成一个名词性结构，作动词tell的直接宾语。

`I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.`

我坐在车的前部，以便包揽农村风光。

>to get a good view: 动词不定式短语作状语，表目的。


`Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.`

完整表达：

After I looked around, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger who was left on the bus. 

> 思维本质：分词结构可以看做是从句的简化。

复习：分词状语

- 场景造句：

I was lying on the beach, with my dog sleeping beside me.

> with引导伴随状语，表示两个动作同时发生。等同于 I was lying on the beach, while my dog sleeping beside me.

> 定语从句的“瘦身”: 只有定语从句的关系代词在从句中充当主语时，才能瘦身。

比如：

I was the only passenger who was left on the bus. 该句中，who充当从句中的主语，因此我们简写成 I was the only passenger left on the bus.


I was the only passenger that the conductor talked to. 该句中，that在从句中充当宾语，因此无法“瘦身”.

> 哪些赘肉“减去”？ 关系代词和be动词

如：

I was the only passenger （who was） left on the bus.

Last night, I met a handsome guy （who was） called Michael.

Michael is a young man who is eager to succeed. = Michael is a young man eager to succeed. 

> 形容词短语做后置定语,可以看做分词短语, being eager to succeed的简化，being累赘，故省略

> 用什么分词做定语？实义动词（表达具体动作的那个动词） 如果主动则用现在分词，如果被动则用过去分词。

I was the only passenger who was left on the bus. = I was the only passenger left on the bus.

I was the only passenger who stood on the bus. = I was the only passenger standing on the bus.

- 造句练习

We visited a castle which was built 100 years ago. 

which 在定语从句中充当主语，因此该句可"瘦身". = We visited a castle built 100 years ago.

The man who is speaking to the audience is the King.

who 在定语从句中充当主语，因此该句可"瘦身". = The man speaking to the audience is the King.

> 特别注意：定语从句什么时候不能简化？

The girl working for Apple is my sister(在苹果公司工作的那女孩是我妹妹).

= The girl who works for Apple is my sister.


若是想表达，曾经在苹果公司工作的那女孩是我妹妹。

The girl who worked for Apple is my sister.

此时，这个定语从句就不能简化成分词定语从句了，why？

若此时简化的话（The girl working for Apple is my sister.） ，就会造成语义歧义。因为默认情况下，我们会认为working的时态与is保持一致，无法表达曾经的状态。
