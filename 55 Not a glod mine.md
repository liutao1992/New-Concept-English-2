### 句型精讲

`The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where--it is said--pirates used to hide gold. The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.`

> 语言点1： 如何表示过去的习惯  used to  VS  would

-  used to的思维：表示过去常做某事，现在不做。

My dad used to run the marathon.
我爸爸过去常跑马拉松。

>But my dad doesn’t run the marathon now

* would的思维：“would” can be used to indicate past habits

> would do sth: 表达过去的习惯

When I was a kid, my mother `would get up` at 6 o’clock in the morning and make breakfast for us. After breakfast, she `would send me to school` and then go to a farmer’s market.On weekends, my parents `would take me for a walk` along the riverside. And my dad would tell me a lot of interesting stories about his college life. I told my dad that I would study hard and go to the best college in the world.

>would get up、would send me、would take me for a walk: 表达的是过去经常做这件事的习惯

>这句的“would study”表达了什么含义？表达是过去的意愿，而非过去的习惯。

> 如何判断：would是表示“过去将来”还是“过去常常做的事”？关键看有没有线索表示出：would是不是“在过去，看将来”这样一个行为。

比如文中的最后一句：I told my dad that I would study hard and go to the best college in the world. 该句表示的是在过去对未来的一种展望的行为--将来去世界上最好的大学去上学

- 思维上对比
- 相同：would和used to都可以表示过去经常做的某件事
- 不同：used to还可以表示过去的状态，而非动作；如果语气上特别强调：“过去不等于现在”最好用used to

如：我过去非常的胖。

>该句描述的是过去的状态，说的是过去很胖的这种状态，而非习惯性的动作。因此我们可以这样说：I used to be overweight；而不能说 I would be overweight.

> 语言点2： 复习where引导的定语从句

The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where--it is said--pirates used to hide gold.

> where修饰的先行词是一个“地点”，where在定语从句中做“地点状语”

对于where引导的比较复杂的定语从句：读到where时，我们心里可以默念在这里。比如当前这句话： 

这里的where表示的是：in a cave

> 分词状语

第一句：

`Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure.`
= While a search party was armed with the new machine, it went into the cave and the search party hoped to find buried treasure.

其中Armed with...做判断状语，hoping to find buried treasure做结果状语

第二句：

`Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep.`
= As the party was excited, the party dug a hole which was two feet deep

其中第二句的最后一部分做了定语从句的简化，省略了which was
