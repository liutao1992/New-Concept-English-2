> 如何精确地回望过去么？

### 句型精讲1

`Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under controller.`

> 过去完成进行时： had been fighting ... 表示这个动作在当时的情况下一直在持续

> 若要表示灭火这个动作在当时火失控之前已经完成，则使用以下时态：过去完成时

`Firemen had put out the forest fire before it went out of control.`

### before的具体使用

两件事先后发生 A happened before B happened

- A持续的时间很长，则before对应中文中的"才"
  
  Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under control.
   
- A持续的时间很短，则before对应中文中的"就"

  Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for less than an hour before the fire was almost put out.

- 不强调A发生的时间，则before对应中文的"然后"

  Firemen had put out the fire before they saved a boy in the house. 

### 句中的could 表示潜在的能力
表示潜在的能力，表示灭火灭了3周，消防队员才感到有能力控制住火势。这只是一种可能性，并没有强调完全成功的控制住火势。这个小小的细节也体现出当时火势的严峻。

> 若要表达成功的控制住火势呢？我们要用 was able to

> 若要强调消防队员与大火搏斗了3个星期，大火才被成功的控制住了，而不仅仅是有能力控制住。

Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they were able to get it under control.

### 句型精讲2
`The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain.`

> 表示天开始下雨的时候，飞机播种的行为还没有完成，还在进行之中。

> 若要表达在下雨之前，飞机已经播种了5吨的草籽。
The planes had planted five tons of the special type of grass-seed when it began to rain.

### had been trying to get in contact with her是一直延续的动作么？
I had been trying to get in contact with Susan, but was unable to do so until I met her last Sunday at a cafe.

> 英文中“进行”这个动作状态的含义 不仅包含延续还有重复

比如：The man had been gambling for years before he went broke. 并非表示该动作一直持续多年，而是表示这么多年来，总是在重复该行为。

Winter was coming on and the hills threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well.

- Winter was coming on....  

表示冬天即将来临，特别注意的是这里使用的是过去进行时，但coming这个动作是不可延续的，所以 was coming on 并不是表示正在来，而是即将来临。表达的是站在过去看将来，相当于是过去将来时，表示的在过去的某个时段对将来的打算。

We were excited as we were flying to Paris the following week.我们很兴奋，因为我们将在下一周飞往巴黎。

> were flying to 表达的并不是当时正在飞，而是表示的是马上即将飞往巴黎，相当于过去将来时。
